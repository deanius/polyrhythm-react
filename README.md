# polyrhythm-react ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶

`polyrhythm-react` gives you ways to use `polyrhythm` in a React context.

`polyrhythm` is a Domain Specific Language for building UIs with JavaScript. [README](https://github.com/deanius/polyrhtyhm)

It's a synthesis of ideas from:

- ðŸ’™JQuery, particularly [#on](https://api.jquery.com/on/) and [#trigger](https://api.jquery.com/trigger/).
- ðŸ’œRxJS. Older than Promises, nearly as old as JQuery.
- ðŸ’œRedux-Observable, Redux Saga, Redux Thunk.

Everyone needs async consequences of events, but `polyrhythm` is a framework-free that supercharges your timing and resource management capabilities _in only **3Kb**_.

## Installation

```
npm install polyrhythm-react
```

You don't need dependencies on RxJSâ€”a minimal amount of capability to return Observables (via `concat` and `after`) is included.
